This is an implementation in F# of the data structures in Chris Okasaki's [Purely Functional Data Structures](http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504)

The solutions to the exercise are also in each of the corresponding data structures modules.

Cool stuff I found while doing this
-----------------------------------
* [Algorithms Animation Workshop](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~aaw/): Nice animations that help in order to understant some of the data structures in the book.
* [Notes about Purely Functional Data Structures](http://cybertiggyr.com/amo/amo.html) Implementations and solutions to the exercises in Lisp.
